Adjusted endpoint names by removing their endpoint group name (\"Networks - get all networks.. --> \"get all networks\")\n- Updated all endpoints with a `{{baseUrl}}` environment variable. This makes it easier to test API proxies, mocks, or target a Meraki Cloud shard (i.e. \"n123.meraki.com\")\n- Included a Template Environment for a quicker start\n\n## Apr 2018\n- Organization Device Summary Status \n  * List the status of every Meraki device in the organization. \n\t-Returns a single array of all devices.\n\n##  Mar 2018\n- MX cellular firewall rules\n  * Return cellular firewall rules\n  * Update cellular firewall rules\n\n## Feb 2018\n- Clone Network\n  * Use the **Create a Network** endpoint with the `copyFromNetworkId` parameter to create a new network with the same settings as the source network.\n\n## Nov 2017\n- MX VPN Firewall Rules\n  * Return the firewall rules for an org\n  * Upate the firewall rules of an org\n\n## Oct 2017\n- Group Policy support\n  * Bind a client to a Group Policy\n  * List Group Policies for a Network\n- MX L3 Firewalls\n  * Return L3 Firewall Rules\n  * Update L3 Firewall Rules\n- Bluetooth Settings\n  * Return Bluetooth Settings\n  * Update Bluetooth Settings\n- Splash authorization\n  * Return Splash Authorization status\n  * Update Splash Authorization status\n- Update the SNMP settings for an organization\n- Phone Assignments\n  * List all phones in a network and their contact assignment\n  * Return a phone's contact assignment\n  * Assign a contact and number(s) to a phone\n  * Remove a phone assignment (unprovision a phone)\n\n# Documentation and Resources\nhttps://api.meraki.com/api_docs\nhttps://create.meraki.io\n\n# Troubleshooting\n- Check your profile permissions. If you can't do it in Dashboard, you won't be able to in the API.\n\n- Some calls seem to work better if you use the shard number instead of \"dashboard\" because of a required redirect. Just update the shard that matches when you login to the web Dashboard. It will be in the URL.\n\n**Original**\n```\n- https://api.meraki.com/api/v0/networks/{{networkId}}/ssids/{{ssidNum}}?name=viaAPI345&number={{ssidNum}}\n```\n**With shard number**\n```\n- https://n123.meraki.com/api/v0/networks/{{networkId}}/ssids/{{ssidNum}}?name=viaAPI345&number={{ssidNum}}\n```",

There are 4 default rules, which can be seen on your network's traffic shaping page. Note that default rules count against the rule limit of 8.\nrules| An array of traffic shaping rules. Rules are applied in the order that they are specified in. An empty list (or null) means no rules. Note that you are allowed a maximum of 8 rules.\ndefinitions| A list of objects describing the definition of your traffic shaping rule. Each definition object has the structure { \"type\": <string>, \"value\": <string OR object> }. \"type\" can be one of 'application', 'applicationCategory', 'host', 'port' or 'ipRange'. If \"type\" is 'host', 'port' or 'ipRange', then \"value\" must be a string, matching either a hostname (e.g. \"somesite.com\"), a port (e.g. 8080), or an IP range (\"1.1.1.1/1\" or \"1.1.1.1\"). If \"type\" is 'application' and 'applicationCategory', then \"value\" must be an object with the structure { \"id\": <string> }, where \"id\" is the application category or application ID (for a list of IDs for your network, use the trafficShaping/applicationCategories endpoint).\nperClientBandwidthLimits| An object describing the bandwidth settings for your rule, with the structure { \"settings\": <string> , \"bandwidthLimits\": { \"limitUp\": <integer>, \"limitDown\": <integer> } }. 'settings' can be set to 'network default', 'ignore' or 'custom'. While 'limitUp' and 'limitDown' are the upload and download speeds, respectively, in Kbps (null indicates no limit). Note that 'bandwidthLimits' are only enforced if 'settings' is set to 'custom'.\ndscpTagValue| The DSCP tag applied by your rule. null means 'Do not change DSCP tag'. For a list of possible tag values, use the trafficShaping/dscpTaggingOptions endpoint.\npriority| A string, indicating the priority level for packets bound to your rule. Can be 'low', 'normal' or 'high'.\n\n### SAMPLE REQUEST\n```\ncurl -L -H 'X-Cisco-Meraki-API-Key: <key>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT 'https://api.meraki.com/api/v0/networks/{networkId}/trafficShaping'\n```\n\n### SAMPLE RESPONSE\n```\nSuccessful HTTP Status: 200\n\n{\n  \"defaultRulesEnabled\": true,\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"definitions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"host\",\n          \"value\": \"google.com\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"port\",\n          \"value\": \"1234\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"ipRange\",\n          \"value\": \"1.1.1.1/1\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"applicationCategory\",\n          \"value\": {\n            \"id\": \"meraki:layer7/category/2\",\n            \"name\": \"Blogging\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"application\",\n          \"value\": {\n            \"id\": \"meraki:layer7/application/133\",\n            \"name\": \"Battle.net\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"perClientBandwidthLimits\": {\n        \"settings\": \"custom\",\n        \"bandwidthLimits\": {\n          \"limitUp\": 1000000,\n          \"limitDown\": 1000000\n        }\n      },\n      \"dscpTagValue\": null,\n      \"priority\": \"normal\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

There are 4 default rules, which can be seen on your network's traffic shaping page. Note that default rules count against the rule limit of 8.\nrules| An array of traffic shaping rules. Rules are applied in the order that they are specified in. An empty list (or null) means no rules. Note that you are allowed a maximum of 8 rules.\ndefinitions| A list of objects describing the definition of your traffic shaping rule. Each definition object has the structure { \"type\": <string>, \"value\": <string OR object> }. \"type\" can be one of 'application', 'applicationCategory', 'host', 'port' or 'ipRange'. If \"type\" is 'host', 'port' or 'ipRange', then \"value\" must be a string, matching either a hostname (e.g. \"somesite.com\"), a port (e.g. 8080), or an IP range (\"1.1.1.1/1\" or \"1.1.1.1\"). If \"type\" is 'application' and 'applicationCategory', then \"value\" must be an object with the structure { \"id\": <string> }, where \"id\" is the application category or application ID (for a list of IDs for your network, use the trafficShaping/applicationCategories endpoint).\nperClientBandwidthLimits| An object describing the bandwidth settings for your rule, with the structure { \"settings\": <string> , \"bandwidthLimits\": { \"limitUp\": <integer>, \"limitDown\": <integer> } }. 'settings' can be set to 'network default', 'ignore' or 'custom'. While 'limitUp' and 'limitDown' are the upload and download speeds, respectively, in Kbps (null indicates no limit). Note that 'bandwidthLimits' are only enforced if 'settings' is set to 'custom'.\ndscpTagValue| The DSCP tag applied by your rule. null means 'Do not change DSCP tag'. For a list of possible tag values, use the trafficShaping/dscpTaggingOptions endpoint.\npcpTagValue| The PCP tag applied by your rule. Can be 0 (lowest priority) through 7 (highest priority). null means 'Do not set PCP tag'.\n\n### SAMPLE REQUEST\n```\ncurl -L -H 'X-Cisco-Meraki-API-Key: <key>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT 'https://api.meraki.com/api/v0/networks/{networkId}/ssids/{number}/trafficShaping'\n```\n\n### SAMPLE RESPONSE\n```\nSuccessful HTTP Status: 200\n\n{\n  \"trafficShapingEnabled\": true,\n  \"defaultRulesEnabled\": true,\n  \"rules\": [\n    {\n      \"definitions\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"host\",\n          \"value\": \"google.com\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"port\",\n          \"value\": \"1234\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"ipRange\",\n          \"value\": \"1.1.1.1/1\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"applicationCategory\",\n          \"value\": {\n            \"id\": \"meraki:layer7/category/2\",\n            \"name\": \"Blogging\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"application\",\n          \"value\": {\n            \"id\": \"meraki:layer7/application/133\",\n            \"name\": \"Battle.net\"\n          }\n        }\n      ],\n      \"perClientBandwidthLimits\": {\n        \"settings\": \"custom\",\n        \"bandwidthLimits\": {\n          \"limitUp\": 1000000,\n          \"limitDown\": 1000000\n        }\n      },\n      \"dscpTagValue\": null,\n      \"pcpTagValue\": null\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
